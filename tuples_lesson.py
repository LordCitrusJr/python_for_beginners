# Tuples are set up similarly to lists but use parentheses instead of brackets.
# They are immutable, meaning parts cannot be modified, however, the entire Tuple can be modified.

name = high_score[0]
print(name)

# The ‘len’ command works the same as on a list.
print(len(high_score))

# Using the ‘in’ operator will check a Tuple for certain criteria and return true or false.
