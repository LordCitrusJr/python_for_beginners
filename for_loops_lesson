# Loops are a very important part of programming, since they allow us to run a piece of code for a set amount of times,
# depending on the situation.

# For variable in variable collection will access all variables in the collection, beginning with the first index 
and ending at the last.
enemy_positions = [5, 10, 15]
for enemy_position in enemy_positions:
    print(enemy_position)

# For x in range(): will run a loop number of times defined in range.
for i in range(0,5):
    print("Hello")

# Every For loop can be converted to a While loop, but not vice versa.
